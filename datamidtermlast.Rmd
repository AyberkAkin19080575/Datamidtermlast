# Introduction
The phenomenon of migration has been a topic of interest in Turkey for many years. With its strategic location and diverse economic and political landscape, Turkey has been a destination and transit country for migrants from various parts of the world. This literature review aims to provide a critical analysis of five articles related to international and internal migration in Turkey. The articles under review examine various aspects of migration in Turkey, including the legal framework, policy development, migration determinants, demographic changes, and social and economic impacts. The review provides insights into the common themes and issues that emerge from the studies and highlights the implications of these findings for data science research and policy development.
